### Hi there 👋

<img src="https://badge.mediaplus.ma/binary/iel-bakk" alt="iel-bakk 42" width="500">

I'm a student at the **42 Network** — a peer-to-peer, project-based programming school.  
I love building things, and I enjoy creating **open-source tools** that are actually useful to people.

- 🔍 Data scraping & analytics dashboards
- 🐍 Python & Flask backends
